                    ever since last semester i've been tired, like, every day no matter how early i sleep or how late i wake up or how much sleep i end up getting throughout the week
                </p>
                <p>
                    im not super sure why i've been this way, but i've been dealing with it, i guess...? every day i feel like i'm sleepwalking through life, though. and every day, every week, they all blend into each other and into the next, and it's all just so confusing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    i feel like i'm losing my life as it passes right by my face. the time slips away from between my fingers.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>
                    i know i have to do something to get past this, but i'm just not super sure what i even can do
                </p>
                <p>
                    i've been trying to go to walks recently, and i know these things take time, and going outside genuinely helps me by giving me time to think to myself, but i just don't really see the point or the benefit of it all. i'm still bedrotting when i get back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    i feel aimless in the summer
                </p>
                <p>
                    and overwhelmed when classes return
                </p>
                <p>
                    i can't get a break no matter how much time i have
                </p>
                <p>
                    and i can't bring myself to do the things i love when i have all the time in the world
                </p>
                <p>
                    what am i supposed to do
                </p>
            </div>
