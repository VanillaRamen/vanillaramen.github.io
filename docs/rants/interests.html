            <h3>programming</h3>

            <p>
                yeah i like computers and programming... big shocker
            </p>

            <p>
                im in uni rn for computer engineering so im doing a whole lot of programming and hardware stuff it's kinda awesome tbh
            </p>

            <p>
                my main goal with pursuing computer engineering is getting better at making machines do whatever i want and making a living off of it. i dont really have a super specific goal with it yet (no endgame job no specific career) but i do wanna end up doing something professionally that has to do with computer engineering.
            </p>

            <p>
                hopefully with time i learn to love hardware :&rpar;
