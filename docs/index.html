        <h3 class="heading">in short</h3>
        <p>
            i'm a student attending university to study computer engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            eventually, i'd like to write software that's useful to people. i'd <em>love</em> to make software that i find useful myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            currently, i think i like systems programming (with C). i haven't tried doing it in Zig or Rust yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            as you can probably tell, i'm also decent at using HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
            i try to avoid using JS where it isn't necessary, since imo that makes certain applications, especially webpages, use a lot of resources that could be used elsewhere.
