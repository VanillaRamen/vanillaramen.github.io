    <p>
        this site is a space i'm using as one of several outlets to express myself. my main outlet of expression is my interactions with other people, so know that what you see here is only a sliver of who i am.
    </p>
    <p>
        as of now, i don't have any photographs or edited photos hosted here, but it's possible that could change in the future. or maybe i'll post them on another platform and link to that platform from this site instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        my main intention with this site, at the time that i'm writing this, is to express myself mainly through text and webpage styling. i hope some of my personality shows through this website.
    </p>
    <p>
        past versions of this site are available to download on my <a href="https://github.com/VanillaRamen">github</a>, espeically under the repository for <a href="https://github.com/VanillaRamen/vanillaramen.github.io">this website</a>.

    </header>
    <p>
        i'm a computer engineering major (essentially computer science crossed with electrical engineering) currently attending an engineering university
    </p>
    <p>
        making webpages is a passion of mine but not my main focus
    </p>
    <p>
        i like writing programs in C++, and i'm currently learning C and an assembly instruction set for a line of microprocessors
    </p>
    <p>
        i also have some experience with Python but i don't really like using the language if i can avoid it. i'm looking at Rust on the side, but it's also not my main focus.
    </p>
    <p>
        eventually, i think i want to work on embedded systems, but that could change as i progress through the curriculum
