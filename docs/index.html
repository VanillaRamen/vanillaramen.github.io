      <p>There isn't anything here right now, but feel free to stay here for a bit.</p>
      <p>And to be honest, I don't even really know what I'm doing here... I'm just trying to make a page...</p>

      <p>A little bit about me... I don't really wanna disclose too much since this is public...</p>
      <p>I learned JavaScript through Codecademy and I'm using a little bit of Codecademy and a little bit of
      MDN Web Docs to get more familiar with HTML and CSS. This website itself is a learning project, though most
      of it is coming from me directly.</p>
      <p>I hope you like my website! :)</p>
      <p>Oh, and... check out this little guy I made!</p>
