<div id="who_am_i">
    <h2>who am i</h2>
    <p>
        im a computer engineering major
    </p>
    <p>
        eventually i wanna work on embedded systems because at the moment i feel inspired by C and assembly
    </p>
    <p>
        i think optimized code and low power machines are awesome
    </p>
    <p>
        i made this site out of pure html and css in my free time &colon;&rpar; you should try it out too! it's fun and relatively easy
    </p>

<div id="my_computer">
    <h2>my computer</h2>
    <p>
        at the moment i use windows 11 but once i get a second ssd i plan on dual booting windows 11 and arch linux. i won't stop using windows 11 because i need to be able to do a lot of things that are just much easier on windows than on linux
    </p>
    <p>
        but i'd love to be able to use linux to be able to customize things more freely and have a machine that truly feels like mine. and the terminals are much nicer to work with through linux compared to through windows.
    </p>
    <p>
        i use firefox for coursework and vivaldi for web browsing & video streaming
    </p>
    <p>
        i use vs code for programming, which i do mainly in c and c++ these days, but i've also used it for python and rust in the past, and i also use it to edit the html for this page. i guess i also <em>happen</em> to use it for writing javascript, but only for my webpages.

<div id="things_i_like">
    <h2>things i like</h2>
    <p>
        as of late i've been really into <span class="pulse">witch hat atelier</span>. it's probably my favorite manga of all time now, and i'm excited to see how the story continues. it's safe to say that it changed my life.
    </p>
    <p>
        i'm also a casual fan of <span class="pulse">one piece</span>. i haven't really been reading or watching it recently, and i'm far from fully caught up, but the stories of friendship and the thought of grouping up in the face of a fascist world government to liberate -- <em>truly</em> liberate -- nations of people for the sake of the people themselves and humanity as a whole... it's so inspiring.
    </p>
    <p>
        i'm also a fan of <span class="pulse">cardcaptor sakura</span>. it's such a nice series, and i'd definitely finish it if i had enough time to.
    </p>
