            <p>
                This is my personal domain on the internet. I made this for myself, but I hope you can enjoy it too.

                Unfortunately, this isn't a website that hosts anything super impressive, like beautiful photographs or gorgeous illustrations (for now). Instead, it's somewhere for me to escape to, building a shelter for my brain brick by brick.

            <h3><span class="blinker">&gt;&nbsp;</span>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                It's not a personal website without a little personal information, is it?
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a computer engineering major at a university known for engineering but not so known that I expect you to know it. At the time of writing (or last updating this text), I'm about to enter my second year of studies in university.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm mainly hoping to be able to work closely with computer architecture and build something I can be proud of. And I especially hope ASM treats me well after a year of working with C++.

            <h3><span class="blinker">&gt;&nbsp;</span>Aspirations</h3>
            <p>
                This is an unreasonable goal, but I think one day I would love to have a keyboard that I made entirely from scratch, down to the computer chip handling all of the logic and protocols (except connectivity like Bluetooth and USB).
            </p>
            <p>
                I know I could just use an existing programmable little computer thing like an Arduino or an ESP32, but wouldn't it be so cool to say that I designed a little chip myself? And it's not like I would need that much computational power.
