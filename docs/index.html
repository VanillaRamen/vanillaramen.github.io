      <p>This is a little about-me page I made mainly as a way to learn HTML, but also as something just to have.</p>
      <p>I don't really know what I'm doing, so the page doesn't look too great right now, but at the end of the day,
      I made it, and that's what really matters. I hope you enjoy being here!</p>

      <p>A little bit about me... I don't really wanna disclose too much since this is public...</p>
      <p>I learned JavaScript through Codecademy and I'm using a little bit of Codecademy and a little bit of
      MDN Web Docs to get more familiar with HTML and CSS. This website itself is a learning project, though most
      of it is coming from me directly.</p>
      <p>I hope you liked my website! :)</p>
      <p>Oh, and check out this little guy I made!</p>
