    <h2>who am i</h2>
    <p>
        im a computer engineering major
    </p>
    <p>
        eventually i wanna work on embedded systems because at the moment i feel inspired by c and assembly
    </p>
    <p>
        i think optimized code and low power machines are awesome
    </p>
    <p>
        i made this site out of pure html and css in my free time &colon;&rpar; you should try it out too! it's fun and relatively easy

    <h2>my computer</h2>
    <p>
        i use a somewhat powerful dell laptop as my daily driver (and as my only laptop). it boots to windows 11 and to <span class="pulse">arch linux</span> (using kde plasma) on two separate drives. i mainly use windows 11 for university coursework and linux to watch youtube; but of course i could do that in windows as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        for gaming, i mainly use windows 11 (because i've had it longer and it's just easier over there) with steam, though i also play some other games that aren't on steam
    </p>
    <p>
        i use <span class="pulse">firefox</span> mainly for coursework and <span class="pulse">vivaldi</span> for web browsing, youtube, and netflix
    </p>
    <p>
        i use <span class="pulse">vs code</span> for programming, which i do mainly in c and c++ these days, but i've also used it for python and rust in the past, and i also use it to edit the html for this page. i guess i also <em>happen</em> to use it for writing javascript, but only for my webpages.

<section id="things_i_like">
    <h2>things i like</h2>
    <p>
        as of late i've been really into <span class="pulse">witch hat atelier</span>. it's probably my favorite manga of all time now, and i'm excited to see how the story continues. it's safe to say that it changed my life.
    </p>
    <p>
        i'm also a casual fan of <span class="pulse">one piece</span>. i haven't really been reading or watching it recently, and i'm far from fully caught up, but the stories of friendship and the thought of grouping up in the face of a fascist world government to liberate -- <em>truly</em> liberate -- nations of people for the sake of the people themselves and humanity as a whole... it's so inspiring.
    </p>
    <p>
        i'm also a fan of <span class="pulse">cardcaptor sakura</span>. it's such a nice series, and i'd definitely finish it if i had enough time to.
    </p>

    <h2>where else can you find me?</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="pulse">nowhere</span>!! don't go looking for me.
    </p>
    <p>
        however, here's this site's <a href="https://github.com/VanillaRamen/vanillaramen.github.io">github repository</a>.
