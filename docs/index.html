        <p>
            i'm a student attending university to study computer engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            eventually, i'd like to write software that's useful to people. i'd <em>love</em> to make software that i find useful myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            currently, i think i like systems programming (with C). i haven't tried doing it in Zig or Rust yet.
