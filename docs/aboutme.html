    <h2>inspirations</h2>
    <p>
        a lot of things inspire me. lately, especially, i've been inspired by witch hat atelier.
    </p>
    <p>
        throughout my life, i don't think there has been one single thing that constantly inspires and drives me to do the things i do, but i'd say in general my friends and family are what inspire me most, followed closely by the wondrous phenomenon of the internet. seriously, the way the internet just seems to <em>work</em> in the modern world is such a wonderful miracle of engineering!
    </p>
    <p>
        i'm also inspired by how easy it is to get started programming. anyone with a computer can go on the internet and learn the basics of programming in an easily accessible language with easily accessible learning software/websites and openly distributed software writing tools (text editors, compilers, interpreters, etc.). it's so cool

    <h2>what i'm doing</h2>
    <p>
        as i'm writing this, i'm currently a student in university studying for a bachelor's degree in computer engineering
    </p>
    <p>
        so far (year 2 at time of writing) it's relatively easy, at least compared to what i hear my mechanical engineering friend and aerospace engineering friend are having to do. my biggest struggle at the moment is circuits, which i just... can't seem to get a hold of the way i understand data structures, calculus, and differential equations. but it is what it is, i guess
    </p>
    <p>
        my favorite courses so far have been digital devices (for its material) and intermediate programming (for its easiness). i also really like microprocessors so far, because i've been able to program a microprocessor in assembly, but circuits just showed up in the slides, so we'll see how i like it from here. it probably won't be as bad as circuits, but... circuits...
    </p>
    <p>
        hey, thanks for reading through this, by the way. i don't know what you're on my site for, but i appreciate you looking at what i have to say. and don't feel pressured to read what i'm writing, either. it's not that important or influential, and it's (probably) not going anywhere
