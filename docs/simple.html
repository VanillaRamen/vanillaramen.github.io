            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p> <!-- dated -- 2025-2026 academic year -->
                I am a current university student studying computer engineering, which at my university is a cross between electrical engineering and computer science. At the moment, I'm in my second year and finding microprocessors to be the most engaging class.

            <p>
                My highest achievement in my life so far was probably being named a National Merit Finalist by the National Merit Scholarship Corporation for my score on the PSAT/NMSQT.

            <p>
                My greatest personal achievement has probably been that I've been able to make enough friends to not be too lonely.

            <h3>Foreground</h3>
            <p>
                It's not set in stone, but in the future, I think I would like to work on embedded systems. I like the idea of creating systems that simply work, need little maintenance, and largely go unnoticed.

                Depending on how the coming semester goes, however, I might end up preferring to work on systems programming. From what I've seen of my older peers' experience with the systems programming course,

                At the end of the day, of course, I would simply like to have a career where I can be happy doing what I'm doing and make enough money to live at the same time.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                I listen to all kinds of music, and lately I've been into K-Pop. I've especially liked listening to LE SSERAFIM, ILLIT, and IVE lately.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from K-Pop, I also listen to progressive metal, progressive rock, experimental rock, jazz fusion, funk, and more! For a (painfully) incomplete list of what I listen to, check out <a href="./aboutme.html#media_i_like" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="noreferrer noopener">this part of my website</a>.

                I also wrote a <a href="https://github.com/VanillaRamen/terminal_blackjack">terminal-based blackjack game</a> written in C. Please check it out!
