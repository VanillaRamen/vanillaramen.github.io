            <p class="blogtext">I'm writing again (at 3:12PM) to say that I've just updated the site! It now has an entrance page that leads into the main page, and I redid how the blog section works. Now, instead of immediately loading one long page, I future-proofed it so there are different pages for different months! I'll definitely have to sort it by day eventually, though. Even by month, the pages get long, and sometimes (like this), I'll do more than one post a day.</p>

            <p class="blogtext">I think it might also be a good idea to start including the time in the date header, but whatever. It is what it is, I guess. Maybe. I don't know. I'll do it eventually. Hopefully. Thanks again for visiting my website.</p>

            <p class="blogtext">It's 1:48 AM on a Thursday morning. I'm pretty tired, but I don't want to sleep. For some reason, I'd rather work on my website. It's just so easy when my GitHub Pages repo integrates into my VS Code client so easily and so well. I wish I'd known about this sooner.</p>

            <p class="blogtext">Anyway, enough about that, and more about this site. I've fleshed out the secret page a little more so it actually has stuff, and I've been tweaking the CSS in pages here and there. It's obviously all very messy, and that's because I don't have any experience or training doing front-end. Hopefully I'll mostly be doing back-end in university and in my future career.</p>

            <p class="blogtext">I know "There's no time like the present," but I want to eventually (and not right now) implement some JavaScript in this site if I can. I know some people don't like that, but I liked the fishing simulator in the past version of my perosnal website.</p>

            <p class="blogtext">Haha, I say "past version," but it really feels more like a past <em>life</em>. That thing was so long ago. I'm proud of it for what it was, but this site looks so much better, even if it's still ugly.</p>

            <p class="blogtext">I can hardly believe all the way I've come, but I know and you know that we're really just getting started here. Here's to many more. Because there's more to come. Just you watch!</p>

            <p class="blogtext">I forgot to mention a certain other manga I'm reading! It's called <u>Inkya Gal Demo Ikigaritai</u>, and I love it! Volume 2 comes out in just 4 days!! I'm so excited to be able to read it soon!</p>

            <p class="blogtext">Also!! Today, I added some hyperlinks to the websites of some of my friends on the main page under the new "Friends" section! Please check out their pages if you haven't already. It would mean a lot to me and especially to them. They're great people! :&rpar; </p>

            <p class="blogtext">I decided today to create a blog section for my website for me to talk about whatever it is I feel like talking about. Like it says right under the title, I'll be updating this every now and then.</p>

            <p class="blogtext">I don't really know what I want to talk about... so I'll talk about the manga I've been reading lately. I picked <u>One Piece</u> back up after not reading it for a while because of how busy school got, but I graduated, so I have enough free time to read more <u>One Piece</u>. I'm currently in the Skypiea arc as of writing, but I'm getting close to the end of it.</p>

            <p class="blogtext">I've also been reading <u>Spy x Family</u>! I think it's absolutely fantastic, and I'm excited for the upcoming chapter. Chapter 102 comes in just 7 days! I've also been enjoying <u>Chainsaw Man</u> for a good, long time, very well over a year at this point. I think it's really great! I have yet to read <u>Fire Punch</u> from the same author, but I hear it's excellent.</p>

            <p class="blogtext">Well, I think that'll be it for today's blog... Thanks for reading my first blog post!</p>
