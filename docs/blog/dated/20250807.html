            <h3 class="cmd">hiccups</h3>
            <p>
                i've been having hiccups (hiccoughs?) since yesterday morning. but i don't think i had them earlier before i took my meds.... i think one of my meds might be giving me hiccups
            </p>
            <p>
                which is kinda strange to me bc i've never heard of hiccups being a side effect of medication but i guess anything's possible isn't it
            </p>
            <p>
                i finished my anti-swelling medication this morning so by tomorrow we'll see if my hiccups stop
            </p>

            <h3 class="cmd">UPDATE</h3>
            <p>
                the time is currently <time datetime="14:28">2:28PM (14:28)</time>. my hiccups have ceased. it's ironic because this is like ~10 minutes after i found out my doctor prescribed a new medication specifically for my hiccups lmao
            </p>
            <p>
                it's a little tragic they went through prescribing a new med for me only for my hiccups to disappear just like that, but oh well. im glad my hiccups are gone now.

            <h3 class="cmd">UPDATE #2</h3>
            <p>
                so the hiccups came back.
            </p>
            <p>
                i made mac & cheese bc i was hungry and i ate it and it was delicious but as soon as i sat back on the couch i got hiccups again.
            </p>
            <p>
                maybe my hiccups have something to do with the couch?????
