            <h3 class="cmd">i needed wisdom tooth extraction</h3>
            <p>
                the date is August 6th, 2025. yesterday, August 5th, 2025, I had all four of my wisdom teeth extracted. this was necessary because my bottom two wisdom teeth were growing in completely sideways (as in, 90 degrees rotated inward), and my upper two wisdom teeth were threatening to overcrowd my top row of teeth.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also needed to get a filling done on one of the molars right next to my bottom wisdom teeth, but the wisdom tooth was covering a crucial part of that molar with some gums, so that procedure wouldn't have been possible without removing my wisdom teeth.

            <h3 class="cmd">how it went</h3>
            <p>
                the procedure itself went really well. I'm told it proceeded very smoothly, like a standard procedure (because it was). I count myself lucky that I was in the care of very patient and understanding people.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also underwent sedation for the procedure, which I'm very glad about. I'm told I wasn't difficult at all under sedation, though when I woke up from it (as I remember), I was super emotional and cried really hard for like 10 minutes.

            <h3 class="cmd">where I am now</h3>
            <p>
                it's currently only the day after the procedure, and it'll take me around 6-8 weeks total (projected) to fully recover.
            </p>
            <p>
                at the moment, i'm on four different medications. two of them are for pain relief, and i'm alternating which ones i take each time i'm scheduled to take them. one of the others is an antibiotic, and the last one is to reduce swelling.
            </p>
            <p>
                technically, the pain relief is "as needed," but I was advised to take pain relief medication on a schedule instead of waiting for pain to actually show up, since that would help me avoid the pain more than not.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also pretty lucky that I haven't been experiencing that much pain at all. I heard a story about someone my mother knows who had his wisdom teeth extracted, and he was in a lot of pain afterwards.
            </p>
            <p>
                in addition to all this medication, I also have some things I need to be doing. today, the day after the procedure, I started doing a saline mouth rinse, with a salt concentration of about 1/4 tsp salt per 1 cup of water, starting with gentle rinsing today and progressing to more vigorous rinsing over the next 3-4 days.
            </p>
            <p>
                since I got my lower wisdom teeth extracted, I'll also have to flush out (irrigate) my lower sockets (voids?) where the wisdom teeth once were with a syringe I was given. my mom says (though I'm sure the doctors/nurses told her first) that this can introduce some pain, but in the long run it'll prevent infection, which is always a plus. I'll be starting this tomorrow, twice a day.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also heard that swelling could end up being an issue, and I don't know if it's because of the anti-swelling medication or because I'm lucky, but I haven't experienced much swelling at all, other than my throat being a little swollen the day of the procedure.

            <h3 class="cmd">where i hope to see myself</h3>
            <p>
                over the next 6-8 weeks, the voids in my mouth where my wisdom teeth once were will fill with new gum flesh, and eventually in those areas I'll have solid masses of just gums, similar to how they were when I still had baby teeth in my mouth and no wisdom teeth in those areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                hopefully I can make a pretty speedy recovery and end up with a fully healed mouth by week 6, since I'll already be back at university by next week.
            </p>
            <p>
                and if I'm being completely honest with myself, I'm not looking that forward to being back at university, especially without a parking permit. I have friends who can drive me places like walmart, but I'd rather have my car to drive myself, really.

            <h3 class="cmd">surgery is kinda wild</h3>
            <p>
                lowkey, isn't surgery a little crazy/metal in general? like, professionally trained people are opening you up in some capacity to like, fix you, whether it's putting something inside you, modifying something inside you, or removing something inside you. that's kinda crazy in my opinion...
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm glad I got my wisdom teeth removed, though. I'll be better off for it, since they were basically threatening the rest of my mouth anyway.
