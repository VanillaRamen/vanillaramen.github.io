            <h3 class="cmd">stitches</h3>
            <p>
                after my oral surgery (getting my wisdom teeth taken out), my surgeon put stitches in my mouth to close the areas where my gums were incised to get to the target teeth.
            </p>
            <p>
                today is day 4 post-operation, and one of my stitches actually came out!! this sounds alarming at first, but the stitches put in my mouth were actually dissolving stitches, and they were scheduled to dissolve within about 5-7 days after the procedure. the wound that the stitch held is also still closed, so i'm doing fine.
            </p>
            <p>
                it alarmed me at first when the stitch actually came out, though. i guess i was expecting it to stay in for a little longer.

            <p>
                overall, i've been doing great after the surgery, all things considered. i've heard stories of pain, gums feeling raw, etc., and i've fortunately experienced none of that so far.
            </p>
            <p>
                despite this, i am a little fearful of potentially developing an infection or some sort of complication. i worry a lot in general, so a whole lot of <em>nothing</em> could end up happening, which would be great, but i'm still scared of the <em>idea</em> of something happening.
            </p>
            <p>
                i think the surgical sites are recovering pretty well thus far, though. they don't look nasty or infected.

                anyway yeah that's pretty much it. one of my stitches came out, but i'm doing fine.
