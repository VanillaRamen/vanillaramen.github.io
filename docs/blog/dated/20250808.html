            <h3 class="cmd">no more hiccups</h3>
            <p>
                yesterday i mentioned i got new meds prescribed for me for my hiccups, but i didn't mention that it turns out the pharmacy didn't have any of that drug in stock, so i ended up not getting them.
            </p>
            <p>
                buuuut that didn't matter anyway because my hiccups ended up completely going away on their own! or at least, they're subsiding rapidly now, and i don't have any hiccups at the moment.
