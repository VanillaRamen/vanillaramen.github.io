                Hi, vaniblog fans! Sorry I haven't been posting to the blog section of my website in a while. I've just been busy with classes at uni.
            </p>

            <p class="blogtext">
                I won't promise I'll post on here more often, because if I'm honest, that's probably impossible. I will say, however, that I do post pretty actively on social media. If you have my discord, you can message me there to ask for my twitter or instagram or even bluesky now (teehee)! Feel free to.
            </p>

            <p class="blogtext">
                Lately, I've been doing pretty alright, I think? All things considered?
            </p>

            <p class="blogtext">
                I wouldn't say I'm doing great, but I could be doing a lot worse. I'm living with a caffeine addiciton, which sucks a lot, but it isn't anything super severe. I haven't been eating the most healthy things, but at least I'm eating, right? I don't have healthy study habits, but I'm pulling through on tests, and I'm able to cram just enough before tests to get a decent grade and not lose my scholarships.
            </p>

            <p class="blogtext">
                My mental health isn't the greatest, since I don't sleep very well at night (my own fault due to poor foresight and weak willpower), but I get through the day well enough, and I'm not suicidal.
            </p>

            <p class="blogtext">
                All that to say... I'm doing fine. Just fine. Not good, but not too bad either. Just fine.
            </p>

            <p class="blogtext">
                I want a place where I can run away to and not be found. I want a place where I can be as alone as I want for as long as I want. That is my heaven. That is where I want to be. It's on the internet somewhere. I just have to find it. Or make my own. It will be there.
            </p>

            <p class="blogtext">
                That's it for this entry. See you <span class="pink">next blog. ðŸ’–</span> I don't know when that will be, but I hope you'll be there for it. Thank you for reading what I have to say. <span class="pink">Goodbye.</span>
