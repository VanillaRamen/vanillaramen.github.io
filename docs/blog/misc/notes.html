                i'm someone who uses vivaldi browser and i just found out you can manually hibernate tabs!! which is pretty big for me because previously (at least last night) i found out vivaldi was taking up like 30-50% of my total RAM. scary...

            <p>
                before now, i never really paid attention to how much RAM individual processes were taking, since i never had a memory leak or ran out of memory or anything like that; but last night, while i was editing a webpage in vs code (some might say using vs code was my first mistake), i somehow ran into a memory leak (i think related to javascript?), and i had to kill vs code through the task manager.
            </p>
            <p>
                it was here that i realized just how much memory vivaldi was also consuming, so i killed that too and reopened it, only to see the memory consumption drop radically!! because only the last active tab was loaded, and everything else was hibernated. it's so fortunate that i figured out you could manually hibernate tabs this morning, because i don't wanna have to keep reopening vivaldi just to free some memory.
            </p>

                someone else recommended brave browser to me but for the reasons that i already use vivaldi. i might check out brave eventually but for now vivaldi already does what i need it to.
