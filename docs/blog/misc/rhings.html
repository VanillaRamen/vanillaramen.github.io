            <p>
                Rhings that I've learned from you is:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Don't be friends who start arguments</li>
                <li>Don't be friends with people who (when they think you're mad) keep trying to get under your skin when you was trying to meme.</li>
                <li>Don't be friends with someone who's purely a meme and their main sense of comedy is insulting people</li>
                <li>Don't be friends with people who make you become a worse person.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Now that I've reflected, there's not anything I can further learn from you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe a tip since you'd need it: If someone reads you as badly as I did and actually somehow falls head over heals, don't just insult him because that's how you make people realise you're a dick
