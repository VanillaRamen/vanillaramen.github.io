            <h3 class="cmd">a struggle</h3>
            <p>
                all living things experience life as a struggle. all of us, in our many methods of survival, are fighting against time, the decay of the universe, the decay of ourselves, the chance that tomorrow might not come, all to experience just a little bit more of reality and existence here on earth.

            <h3 class="cmd">losses</h3>
            <p>
                for many animals, the struggle of life also has an emotional aspect. we live, we die, we grieve, and sometimes, we never move on.
            </p>
            <p>
                i've experienced some losses myself, and none of them have been easy, but that's part of what life is. another struggle.
            </p>

        <article>
            <h3 class="cmd">gains</h3>
            <p>
                despite the losses, there are reasons to keep going.
            </p>
            <p>
                there are many ways to get a leg up on the looming reaper, and from my perspective, all of these have to do with alleviating or avoiding the overarching struggle of life. mainly (off the top of my head), these are:
                <ul>
                    <li>avoiding life</li>
                    <li>suspending life</li>
                    <li>loving life</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                at face value, these (at least the first two) may seem similar, but there are some key differences among them that are illustrated in some relatively common ways people cope with life.
            </p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h3 class="cmd">avoidance</h3>
            <p>
                people avoid life all the time. procrastination is common everywhere, and it's especially prevalent among students.
            </p>
            <p>
                whether it's doing a chore, working on an assignment, or finishing a project, all of these things and more can take a mental toll, big or small, on anyone. usually, the idea of doing these things can be more stressful than the action of actually doing them, but that realization alone isn't enough to prevent avoiding doing these tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                and so, rather than engaging with the struggle of life, many people put off these tasks for as long as they can afford before even beginning them. it's easier on the mind to start a two-week project one hour before the deadline than to continuously work on it over the course of the allotted two weeks; it's easier to keep playing video games than to sit down and do the paperwork you've been meaning to complete for the past week.
            </p>

        <article>
            <h3 class="cmd">suspension</h3>
            <p>
                sometimes, even observing life as it is can be too much.
            </p>
            <p>
                and so people choose to change their perception entirely. there are many ways this is done.
            </p>
            <p>
                some people choose drugs. alcohol can open your mind to suggestion, make you tipsy, and cause you to forget all your problems. some people get so addicted to this feeling that they chase it down the bottle, week by week, day by day, and they find themselves at the bottom of a deep well, unable to get out.
            </p>
            <p>
                other people choose weed. it's "not as bad as alcohol," some people say. it's "not even addictive," they say in defense of their habits. and yet some people spend every waking hour of their lives high on weed, unable to get off of it. they know best the effects of marijuana, even that it lowers your effective iq when you're a regular user, but they use it regularly anyway. because anything is better than the cruelty of life as it is.
            </p>
            <p>
                there are many other drugs, and many other states of mind, and even without drugs people find a way to escape. some people choose porn, some people choose video games, some people choose chat rooms; they all serve as a fantasy and an escape from their day-to-day realities, even if only for an hour, or a few.

            <h3 class="cmd">facing it head on, and... loving it?</h3>
            <p>
                the rare few tackle life head on, sober, and happy. how strange.
            </p>
            <p>
                life is going to come at your whether you like it or not, no matter how long you avoid it or try to escape it.
            </p>
            <p>
                it won't leave, and you can't leave it either; it's a part of your being.
            </p>
            <p class="cmd">
                "Your thread of consciousness is woven into the fabric of life."
            </p>
            <p>
                so the best thing you can do is take care of it. learning to love yourself with all of your flaws is to learn to love your life with all of its hardships. and the sooner you start, the longer you'll be happy.

            <h3 class="cmd">intelligently</h3>
            <p>
                humans are one of the most intelligent organisms on the planet, and the absolute most developed in the universe (to our knowledge). this is a blessing, but it also comes with many challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                life is unrelenting, and time progresses endlessly, but reality isn't impossible to face.
            </p>
            <p>
                it becomes easier when we face it together.
            </p>
            <p>
                reach out, build community, and live a little.
