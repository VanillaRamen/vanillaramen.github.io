            <p class="blogtext">I forgot to mention a certain other manga I'm reading! It's called <u>Inkya Gal Demo Ikigaritai</u>, and I love it! Volume 2 comes out in just 4 days!! I'm so excited to be able to read it soon!</p>

            <p class="blogtext">Also!! Today, I added some hyperlinks to the websites of some of my friends on the main page under the new "Friends" section! Please check out their pages if you haven't already. It would mean a lot to me and especially to them. They're great people! :)</p>

            <p class="blogtext">I decided today to create a blog section for my website for me to talk about whatever it is I feel like talking about. Like it says right under the title, I'll be updating this every now and then.</p>

            <p class="blogtext">I don't really know what I want to talk about... so I'll talk about the manga I've been reading lately. I picked <u>One Piece</u> back up after not reading it for a while because of how busy school got, but I graduated, so I have enough free time to read more <u>One Piece</u>. I'm currently in the Skypiea arc as of writing, but I'm getting close to the end of it.</p>

            <p class="blogtext">I've also been reading <u>Spy x Family</u>! I think it's absolutely fantastic, and I'm excited for the upcoming chapter. Chapter 102 comes in just 7 days! I've also been enjoying <u>Chainsaw Man</u> for a good, long time, very well over a year at this point. I think it's really great! I have yet to read <u>Fire Punch</u> from the same author, but I hear it's excellent.</p>

            <p class="blogtext">Well, I think that'll be it for today's blog... Thanks for reading my first blog post!</p>
