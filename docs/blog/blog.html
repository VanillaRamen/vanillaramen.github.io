            <p class="blogtext">I decided today to create a blog section for my website for me to talk about whatever it is I feel like talking about. Like it says right under the title, I'll be updating this every now and then.</p>

            <p class="blogtext">I don't really know what I want to talk about... so I'll talk about the manga I've been reading lately. I picked <u>One Piece</u> back up after not reading it for a while because of how busy school got, but I graduated, so I have enough free time to read more <u>One Piece</u>. I'm currently in the Skypiea arc as of writing, but I'm getting close to the end of it.</p>

            <p class="blogtext">I've also been reading <u>Spy x Family</u>! I think it's absolutely fantastic, and I'm excited for the upcoming chapter. Chapter 102 comes in just 7 days! I've also been enjoying <u>Chainsaw Man</u> for a good, long time, very well over a year at this point. I think it's really great! I have yet to read <u>Fire Punch</u> from the same author, but I hear it's excellent.</p>

            <p class="blogtext">Well, I think that'll be it for today's blog... Thanks for reading my first blog post!</p>
