        <p>
            my laptop now dual boots to both windows 11 and arch linux! or i guess to some people it's technically <em>not</em> "dual booting" since i'm using two separate drives for two separate operating systems
        </p>
        <p>
            but still, i'm using two operating systems now! isn't that incredible?

    <section id="why">
        <h2>but why did i do this</h2>
        <p>
            at first, the main reason i wanted to dual boot windows and arch linux was so that i could say "i use arch btw" because i thought it was funny
        </p>
        <p>
            but now, i see a lot of upsides to being able to use a more lightweight operating system in general right beside windows
        </p>
        <p>
            for one, it's much more gentle on my laptop's battery, which is very important to me, since my laptop's battery life isn't super great to begin with, being a dell laptop and all
        </p>
        <p>
            i can also do a lot of things in linux that makes it totally worth it. for instance, i wrote this part of my website from my arch system! i can also obviously watch youtube and netflix!
        </p>

        <h2>surprisingly easy</h2>
        <p>
            it was also surprisingly easy to install arch linux... and to install things to make <em>using</em> it easy!
        </p>
        <p>
            full disclosure, i used the <strong>archinstall</strong> script while installing arch. i <em>know</em> a ton of people on the internet, and especially <em>reddit</em> don't want people new to linux, and especially arch, to use the <em>archinstall</em> script, but it got arch installed for me, and once had an environment where i could easily <em>use</em> arch, i found it a lot easier for me to <em>learn</em> arch, and especially linux in general
        </p>
        <p>
            and honestly, don't let people on the internet tell you what to do, especially with <em>your</em> computer! chances are, you don't learn the exact same way they do! so why would you try to do the exact same things they do!
        </p>
        <p>
            things like "do exactly as i do" only apply to set sciences like math where there's only one right answer. computers (for the most part) aren't always like that, so i say use <em>archinstall</em> if you want to while installing arch, even if it's your first time
        </p>
        <p>
            also, i'm using kde plasma. i like it, but i wanna try using something else when i have the free time. i feel like i haven't explored everything i want to, in terms of what the linux community has created and published to make the experience of using linux just a little better. i wanna make this system really feel like it's <em>mine</em> one of these days
