            <p>Hi. Welcome to my new blog.</p>

            <p>If you're one of the few people in the world reading this, sincerely, thank you! It means a lot to me and warms my heart, even if I don't know you, and even if I'll never know you were here.</p>

            <p>If you've been keeping up with my blog in real time for some reason, sorry about the sudden big change in my blog's style. I wanted to keep this blog somehow going, but I didn't like how hard it was to make a new html page each time I wanted to do a new blog entry.</p>

            <p>I do still like the format of making new html pages though, and I don't want to buy my own domain and pay a company to host php code or whatever, so I decided to simplify the html & css down to be more bare-bones. I hope you don't mind the new style!</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Since it's an entirely new blog format, I guess I'll reintroduce myself. It'll also be good for the record/archive.</p>

            <p>Hi! It's nice to meet you. On the internet, I go by "vani." I hope you enjoy my website.</p>

            <p>Currently, I'm a university freshman majoring in computer engineering. My dream is to find success and a job I can use as a creative problem-solving outlet. I'm not looking to change the world, but that would definitely be nice.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>And here's a life update! It's Christmas morning at 2AM! I decided to overhaul the blog section of my website instead of sleeping. I think it was worth it.</p>

            <p>Today, I ate at Waffle House, walked in the woods, and had a total of three cups of coffee. I'd say it was a good day.</p>

            <p>Before today, until December 11th, I'd had semester finals for my first semester at uni. After finals, I ended up passing all my courses with all A's!</p>

            <p>I can't look up the exact number scores now, since it's so late into winter break (and I forgot to check), but for GPA purposes it doesn't matter. I do remember, though, that I made an 88 on my Calculus II final and finished with an overall 94.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Oh. One more thing.</p>

            <p>&#128065;&#65039;&UnderBar;&#128065;&#65039;</p>

            <p>You just lost The Game. Yep. I made you think about it. You have now lost. Just now. Because of me. I got you.</p>

            <p>See you again soon!</p>
