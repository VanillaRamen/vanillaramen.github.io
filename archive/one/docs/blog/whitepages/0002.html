            <p>Hi!!!</p>

            <p>It's the night before New Year's Eve! I'm pretty excited. I wonder if you are too? Oh, but you can't tell me yet, since I haven't implemented or signed up for anything like that.</p>

            <p>You're here for me, right? I'll tell you about me these past few days.</p>

            <p>Just so you know, I don't really "celebrate" Christmas, at least not in the typical way you see American families on TV celebrate Christmas. Regardless, though, it came and went, and I found it enjoyable.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>I've been playing Minecraft on a server with a pretty cool online community. I spent time with my family, but on Minecraft is really mostly how I spent my Christmas, if I'm being honest. It was nice!</p>

            <p>You'll have to forgive me for yapping about nonsense for a few paragraphs, but this is also my blog, so I'm gonna do whatever I want. Skip to the next section if you want.</p>

            <p>Lately, I've been doing a lot of redstone in Minecraft. It really feels like I'm reviewing material from my Digital Devices course, like it's all hardware. Almost.</p>

            <p>I've been having a lot of fun doing item processing in Minecraft, especially with the Crafter item, but I can't find a way to make it automatic, fast, and without glitches. (Those darn edge-cases!!)</p>

            <p>My redstone world is also getting filled with prototypes. I don't really wanna make a new world for redstone, though. It feels like that would be a waste of storage space on my laptop.</p>

            <p>I've also been exploring new mods and resource packs. My current go-to resource packs, on top of whatever I have from VanillaTweaks, are JICKLUS and DramaticSkys. These resource packs, I feel like, just make the game a lot more bearable to play. I feel more fulfilled when I can look at the in-game sky and see something as beautiful as when I look up in real life.</p>

            <p>In Minecraft, I've also been making a lot of rails lately. Ever since I realized that you could merge two minecarts in one block and have them go on indefinitely on rails (three minecarts for going indefinitely OFF rails), minecarts have just been more fascinating for me. It's so cheap when you use stacked minecarts!</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Okay, enough Minecraft. Let's talk about... my mental state? I don't really know what to talk about. I'm sorry.</p>

            <p>I find I'm more and more dependent on caffeine lately, even after the Fall semester has finished. I just can't get good quality sleep at night, and I don't really know the reason why. Maybe it's that damn phone... Nah.</p>

            <p>It just might be a problem, though. The caffeine thing. I should be able to function normally without it, but I don't feel normal without some caffeine in my system.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Oh! Enough about caffeine, I recently bought <em>Fashion Dreamer</em>!!!</p>

            <p>I've been playing it soooo so much lately! It's incredible!! I think it might be one of my best purchases on the Nintendo Switch, up there with <em>Fire Emblem Engage</em> and <em>Octopath Traveler II</em>!</p>

            <p>I first heard about <em>Fashion Dreamer</em> from a clip of Jacob Alpharad's friend Adrianna talking about how she plays it from now and then where she also showed some footage of the game. I'm so glad I ended up buying it earlier, even if it's been a long time since I saw the clip.</p>

            <p>I never knew playing with fashion in a game like that could make me so happy!! I love seeing my avatar be super stylish!</p>

            <p>I also want to get back into <em>Fire Emblem Engage</em> and <em>Octopath Traveler II</em> sometime soon... Maybe I'll take the Switch with me to uni for the spring semester? I tried taking my 3DS with me after Fall Break but never ended up playing on it much. I'll have to think about the Switch a little more.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Anyway, that about wraps up my update. Thanks for reading!</p>

            <p>And! If! I! Figure! It! Out! I <em>might</em> set up a way to get my blog on your RSS Feed. <em>If</em> you want to. I know I'm not particularly interesting, but yeah.</p>

            <p>Please stick around! Thank you!!</p>
