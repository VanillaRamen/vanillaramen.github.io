            <h3><span class="highlight">programming</span></h3>

            <p>
                yeah i like computers and programming... big shocker
            </p>

            <p>
                im in uni rn for <span class="highlight">computer engineering</span> so im doing a whole lot of programming and hardware stuff it's kinda awesome tbh
            </p>

            <p>
                my main goal with pursuing computer engineering is getting better at <span class="highlight">making machines do whatever i want</span> and making a living off of it. i dont really have a super specific goal with it yet (no endgame job no specific career) but i do wanna end up doing something professionally that has to do with computer engineering.
            </p>

            <p>
                hopefully with time i learn to love hardware :&rpar;

            <p>
                ive also played some stardew valley but the timer for each day in that game makes me a little anxious and like im not doing enough with my time so i havent really sat down and played it recently... i already struggle to manage my time irl i dont wanna do all that in a video game lowkey
            </p>

            <p>
                eventuallyyyyyyyy i wanna make my own game maybe probably but idk when that's gonna be bc it's just sooo complicated
