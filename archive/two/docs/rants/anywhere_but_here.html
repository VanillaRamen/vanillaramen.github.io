            <p>i wish i were anywhere but here</p>
            <p>
                i wish i was in a nyc hotel for 48 hours<br>
                a high-rise with balconies and windows<br>
                one right by my desk<br>
                so i could watch the people while i take care of things
            </p>
            <p>
                i wish i could lie in bed all day<br>
                and watch anime i've wanted to watch<br>
                and read manga i've been meaning to read<br>
                and finally let go of the things that have brought me down
            </p>
            <p>
                i wish i could get away from it all<br>
                the stress and anxiety<br>
                the life or death<br>
                the finals
            </p>
            <p>
                is being an engineer worth it<br>
                if every day i get closer<br>
                to thinking of ending it all<br>
                if i never reach my first design
            </p>
            <p>
                what would it all have been for<br>
                if i end up throwing it all away<br>
                an untimely end<br>
                to something that just began
            </p>
            <p>
                what would it all have been for
            </p>
            <p>
                i wish i were anywhere but here
