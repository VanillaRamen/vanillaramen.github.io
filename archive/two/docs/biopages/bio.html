                I'm a computer engineering student aspiring to become someone who makes things that other people find useful!

                I was born in Southeast Asia but moved to the United States at a young age. As a result, for most of my life, I've felt kind of torn between two cultures. I'm too American to be as Southeast Asian as my relatives, ancestors, and peers back in Southeast Asia, but I'm also... not as "American" as my peers.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I found peers just like me, people who came from different backgrounds, had different definitions of what it meant to be "American," were able to understand the struggle of defining oneself, I didn't feel as alone. Now I don't really label myself as one thing, because I realized I was a product of my environments, not just a person living in a country; and those environments include not only my surroundings, but also the people around me, and my ethnic background, and the current times, and so many other things.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of the day, I'm me, and that's what matters most; not whether or not I qualify to identify a certain way.

                I've always wanted to do some sort of engineering. I remember in elementary school being asked what my dream job was. I knew I wanted to create things that other people could use, so at the time I said I wanted to do construction, especially for the design element of it all.
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn't know it at the time, but my whole family has a history of engineering; in retrospect, it's apt, though, since we're Filipinos. I have an uncle who works as a civil engineer, and another uncle who is a retired aerospace engineer. Engineering is in my blood, and any less would have been an anomaly.
            </p>
            <p>
                This dream of engineering truly solidified in the middle of my high school years, and it culminated in me declaring my major as computer engineering. Initially, I wasn't sure what kind of engineering I wanted to do. I was considering doing mechanical engineering, since that would have allowed me to pivot into a lot of other fields, once I narrowed down what I wanted to do. However, during high school, I really got into programming, and I ended up self-studying enough to know the basics of programming. Since I liked programming so much, I realized I would be happy enough doing this my whole life, but I also wanted to work with computer hardware, so I decided to become a computer engineer.

            <h3 id="title">Goals</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                As a computer engineering major, obviously, first and foremost, I want to graduate. Secondly, I want to have fun while I'm here in uni. But I also want to grow myself and my skills. There's a lot to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for more tangible goals, I think, in the future, I'd like to design my own keyboard. It sounds like a fun project, doesn't it?
            </p>
            <p>
                I'd also like to design my own computer mouse. The ones I have right now are fine, but they're either too loud, too bulky, or just don't support my hand in a way I need. Or they're wired. Ideally, I get a wireless mouse with none of these problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                This one is a pretty big stretch, and a lot more software-intensive, but I think, pie-in-the-sky, it'd be really cool to design my own operating system. Maybe even my own central processing unit. Just throwing things out there. Maybe I'd do it alongside one of my friends. It would be cool.

                Anyway, that's it. Thanks for reading about me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keep me in your thoughts, maybe. Or don't. :&rpar;
